[["index.html", "A Visual Study of the 2022 Poster Movement of Chinese Diaspora Chapter 1 Introduction", " A Visual Study of the 2022 Poster Movement of Chinese Diaspora Siyu Yang 2022-12-19 Chapter 1 Introduction On Oct. 13, days before China’s 20th Communist Party Congress, a protester unfurled two banners on a highway overpass in central Beijing denouncing Xi Jinping as a “despotic traitor.” The action inspired a young generation of Chinese diaspora to express their anger by putting up anti-Xi and anti-dictatorship posters, many echoing the message expressed on the Sitong Bridge banner: We don’t want relentless nucleic acid testing, we want food to eat; We don’t want lockdowns, we want freedom; We don’t want lies, we want dignity; We don’t want a repeat of Cultural Revolution, we want political reform; We don’t want dictators, we want elections; We don’t want to be slaves, we want to be citizens. The action is remarkable since for those who grow up under authoritarian rule, expressing dissents in online space might not be new, but extending their expression into the physical space around them requires overcoming intense paranoia, self-censorship, and indoctrination. For this project, I hope to explore the poster movement by visualizing images of poster sightings, and attempt to study the below considerations: What are the messages on the poster? Are they only expressing discontent on China’s zero-COVID policy, or going as far as calling for a regime change? What does the geologic spread tell us about the movement? Many observers and reporters already picked up that the poster movement is led by young Chinese overseas students - are some regions over or under represented than others? How did the movement react to the 20th Communist Party Congress news cycle? Does the data align with the observation that there is a spike in action after Xi declared a third term? "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Data Collection", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Data Collection The poster movement, as many recent grassroots movements under authoritarian regimes, are organized under the decentralization doctrine, dubbed by Hong Kong protesters as “无大台” – “No central stage”. Without central organizers or leading platforms, information are passed through a collection of often anonymous nodes, each node serving very specific purpose, causing data to be relatively scattered and posing a challenge to the data collection process. 2.1.1 Data Avaliability In the spirit of limiting research scope, I will be focusing on the below three sources: Instagram page @northern_square and @citizendailycn - community maintained accounts that distributes of poster sightings from community submissions. Some sightings are shared using Instagram’s “story” feature (non-permanent display) and “post” feature (permanent display). myduty.net - community maintained website that collects and displays poster sightings from anonymous submission. Telegram Groups - An encrypted instant messaging application favored by organizers across the world; many groups spun up in reaction to the poster movement. 2.1.2 Data collection Methods Due to the distributed nature of the dataset, I will be using two methods for data collection. - Scraping - I will be building a scraper to collect all public posts by @northern_square and @citizendailycn, and all public submissions on myduty.net . - Surveying - I have distributed a google form through Telegram groups and Instagram DMs, and have collected 140 entries as of November 1st, 2022. As described in the visualization below, the parser will be collecting data from the two Instagram pages, as well as myduty.net, and the Google Form will be collecting data from Telegram channels. Data will be stored in a Google Drive, which is loaded into AirTable for tagging and cleaning. 2.1.2.1 Data Points to be Collected Image of the poster sighting Location of the poster sighting Message on the poster Basic demographics of participants (only for survey submissions) 2.1.3 Scraping Ethics and Safety Considerations 2.1.3.1 Safety I will be manually removing any personally identifiable information or information that may pose a risk to the submitter or the poster creator, including but not limited to image EXID, uncovered faces, names, etc. I will not be distributing the Google form in Wechat or any social media platform monitored by Chinese government entities. I will use my discretion to collect and store submission from individuals currently still residing in Chinese jurisdiction. 2.1.3.2 Consent I will only be collecting data with either expressed consent for permanent storage, or is already stored in publicly available forums. The Google Form I distributed has explicit terms requesting consent for storage. myduty.net only collects user submitted data, and we can infer data scraped from the website are provided by users consenting to making the image permanently avaliable online. @northern_square and @citizendailycn also collects user submitted data, but some submissions are displayed in “post” format, which is permanently available, and some in “story” format, which will be automatically deleted in 24 hours. I will not be scraping submissions displayed in the “story” format. 2.1.4 Data Quality Considerations - Data Bias All three data collection measures are heavily susceptible to collection biases. The two Instagram pages are manually maintained by community members, so I will be expecting more active posting behaviors around news events. The survey is distributed manually by me, and I am expecting a recency bias between the time I share the survey in Telegram chat groups and the time people submit their poster sightings Data Quality. Since all submissions are manual free text, I am expecting the heavy lifting to be around data cleaning and data tagging . "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Goal 3.2 Data Collection 3.3 Data Cleaning 3.4 Transformation and Result", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Goal Many efforts popped up to collect and share information about the movement – including myduty.net and many instagram and Twitter accounts. But most are designed for easy to share and to gauge momentum during a political movement, but are not in a usable format for visualization and research. I hope to create a data collection and data cleaning workflow that achieves the following goals - Create a queryable version of the poster image dataset that can be easily manipulated in a dataframe; A unique ID should be created to link the image file to other features; Manually entered fields (e.g. locations) should be standardized; Features created (e.g. what the poster is about) should be easily queryable, in boolean or categorical fields. Create a reproducible workflow that allows me to continuously scrape, clean and maintain this dataset. Sharing this dataset on GitHub will not cause an privacy risk for protest participants. 3.2 Data Collection 3.2.1 Instagram pages The phenomenon of overseas Chinese protestors using Instagram to distribute information and organize protests is well documented in mainstream media (Wired and NYTimes). Most notably, @northern_square and @citizendailycn can be pinpointed as the central hub of information. In an interview with Wired, Bei, a New York based artist who manages @northern_square described that his followers would print out the poster templates that are shared on social media, put up the same slogan in their cities in solidarity with the Sitong Bridge protester, and then submitting the pictures to Bei, who will then share the picture on his Instagram story. During the height of the movement, he would receive hundreds of submissions a day, and his Instagram story would look like an endless stream of posters. To collect information shared by those two accounts, I first convert their Instagram pages into JSON format by adding the query string ?__a=1&amp;__d=dis to their Instagram profile’s HTML address. Then the JSON can be downloaded to a local file, which I parsed using scripts/instagram_scraper.py into tabular format. The output of the scraper is a .csv file containing metadata information of the images scraped, as well as the image files, connected by a unique filename field. The results scraped from the Instagram pages only includes the image themselves and the post caption, and does not include any information with regard to who submitted the image or where the picture was taken. However, due to the curated nature of the post, this dataset includes some of the most compelling graphics - 3.2.2 Community Maintained Website myduty.net is a spin off of @citizendailycn, built and maintained by community members, which collects and displays poster sightings from anonymous submissions. I built a simple scraper scripts/website_scraper.py using python’s BeautifulSoup package. The output of the scraper is a .csv file containing metadata information of the images scraped as a tabular format, as well as the image files, connected by a unique filename field. The results scrapped from the website does not include information about the submitter, but does include the location of the poster. 3.2.3 Survey A survey is distributed to followers of @northern_square to submit sightings of poster or their own posters. The survey collects both pictures of the poster and a brief survey on submitter demographics. The form is also distributed in protesters’ Telegram groups. The result of the survey is then passed through scripts/form_data_cleaner.py to wrangle into tabular format. Figure 3.1: @northern_square calling for followers to submit their posters through Google form 3.3 Data Cleaning By the end of November, I have collected 734 image files from the Google form, 360 image files scraped from myduty.net, and 151 scraped from both Instagram accounts. There are a lot of data quality issues associated with the data set: Location data are entered by the submitter, thus requires manual cleaning before we can use geocoder to standardize; Google automatically pulls the username of the form submitter to name the file they uploaded, causing a privacy risk; Duplicate submissions exist between the three channels; Some submissions or scrapped content are not pictures of posters (e.g. other Instagram posts, spams, etc); Image data requires manual tagging to extract queryable information; Image data contains EXIF data, which includes camera information and occasionally detailed GPS location of where the picture was taken; Some submissions include personally identifiable information. To account for the above issues, I loaded the images and metadata files into Airtable, with image url as the unique key between metadata and images. Figure 3.2: Airtable data tagging interface. File Path blocked since it includes the Gmail user name of the submitter This set up allows me go through every submission to add features and standardize text fields. New entries to the database will be automatically added to the end of the queue. 3.3.1 New columns created message - what is the message the protester is trying to express? The Sitong Bridge slogan, or variation of the slogan Directly addressing Xi Jinping Calling for woman’s rights and / or queer rights Calling for solidarity with foreign anti-authoritarian movement in Iran or Russian Calling for solidarity with domestic anti-authoritarian movement in Hong Kong or by Uyghurs Included detailed explanation of the event background to raise awareness for what is going on in China format - what is the form of the expression? Poster Graffiti Handwritten message (often added as a response to the poster) Chalk language used - What is the language used in the submission? English Chinese etc. 3.3.2 Columns updated Location The location field submitted from Google form or parsed from myduty.net are manually cleaned to be more recognizable by geocoding services e.g. “Downstairs cafeteria in UCLA student center” will be updated to “UCLA” When location is not submitted but can be inferred from the image via landmarks or other information (e.g. school name on a neighboring poster), location is manually populated. A boolean field is added to check if the location is on a University campus 3.3.3 Row Removal Criteria Repeated submissions; Submissions outside of time range; e.g. a set of photography documenting 2019’s Hong Kong protests Posts scrapped from @northern_square and @citizendaily_cn that are not relevant to the poster movement; Submissions have personally identifiable information. 3.4 Transformation and Result In the last step, the cleaned files are pulled through Airtable API back into Python for final cleaning. The cleaning script script/EDA_data_cleaning achieves the following goals - The cleaned location field are geocoded using Geopy, and are parsed into Latitude, Longtitude and Country; The tagged features (messages, languages, formats) were stored in Airtable as lists, which are parsed into seperate columns of boolean values; A unique identifier filename is created to link the features with images; EXIF data on each image are removed. The final output of data cleaning has 692 unique entries and 40 columns, 30 of which are boolean features. The 5 columns with missing values are gender (0.27), address (0.02), latitude (0.15), longitude (0.15) and country (0.07). ## gender address latitude longitude country ## 0.26734104 0.02312139 0.14884393 0.14884393 0.07514451 "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Poster data Exploratory Analysis", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Poster data Exploratory Analysis Most submitters declared their gender identity as women, and only 1/4 of submitters declared their identity as male. It is hard to pin down the cause of this discrepancy without more data, but some interesting hypothesis can be formed: are Chinese women more radicalized from the #Metoo movement and are more empowered to take political action? Is there a gender bias in @northern_square’s follower base, which is the primary distribution source of the survey? The vast majority of the posters we collected directly reference the Sitong Bridge message (522 out of 692). More than half of the posters directly calls on Xi Jinping and end of his regime. Most participants shared a picture of a poster, but some expressed their creativity via graffiti, chalk art, or wrote hand-written messages. Even the dataset is only less than 700 entries, we can already observe the significant geographic spread of the movement. The largest number of posters came from the United States, followed up Canada, UK and Japan. This distribution largely coincides with the size of the Chinese diaspora presence in the country. The geographic spread is corroborated by the diversity of languages that appear on the posters. Although almost all posters appear in non-Chinese speaking nations, Chinese is used in 2/3 of the posters, suggesting that the message is address both to a foreign audience as well as towards others in the diaspora. Mapping the number of posters from early October to mid-November, we can see that the movement mobilizes within one or two days after major news events. After the 10/13 protest on Sitong Bridge, there is an almost immediate response, and daily poster counts reached its first peak within two days of the protest. The second peak is reached after the result of China’s Twentieth National Party Congress is revealed. The percentage of posters directly calling on Xi (line in blue) jumped from less than half to 70% of all submissions (line in red). The third peak happened after two large scale protests broke out in London and in New York. Note that the third peak might also be a reflection of collection bias - @northern_square shared the Google form survey link on their instagram page on November 3rd, causing a larger inflex of submissions Mapping the number of posters by day of the week, we observe that most entries are timestamped to Thursday and Friday, which deviates from the conventional wisdom that protest see better attendances over the weekend. The increase on Thursday and Friday can partially be explained by the increase of posters posted on University campus (blue), pointing to the possibility that most participants of the poster movements are students, who tend to push their “extracurriculars” to Thursdays and Fridays. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion 6.1 Why this project? 6.2 What comes next?", " Chapter 6 Conclusion Although the 692 posters we analyzed barely captured the scale of the movement, we can observe the following traits: Participants are spread across the world; Most submitter identify as women; Most posters appeared on University campuses; The movement mobilizes quickly and is very reactive to the news cycle; A significant portion of the participants directly calls on Xi Jinping. 6.1 Why this project? One aspect of living in a totalitarian state is that one’s memory gets re-written by the state. The Tiananmen massacre never happened; China never denied the existence of COVID early 2020 and never prosecuted doctors; protesters and dissents get forgotten as they “disappear”. What broke my heart when I saw the lone protester on Beijing’s Sitong bridge was that he was alone, and I fear for him the same fate as many who came before him: the protestor get taken in to custody, his pictures taken off from the internet, his action forgotten. Unable to stop the first two from happening, many pledge to take over the torch to make sure that the Sitong bridge message is heard around the world, and will not be easily forgotten. Curating this dataset is my contribution to the movement. The Internet is humanity’s collective memory, but the Internet under censorship is forced to forget over and over again. Posting on social media is a job not finished; in order to write this movement into history, we need to document it in a way that could be useful to reporters and researchers. As a data scientist, I am inspired by a quote from the late great Aaron Swartz (also fitting as we are using Markdown, which he created in 2004): Transparency can be a powerful thing, but not in isolation. So, let’s stop passing the buck by saying our job is just to get the data out there and it’s other people’s job to figure out how to use it. Let’s decide that our job is to fight for good in the world. I’d love to see all these amazing resources go to work on that. As the “other people” whose job is to “figure out how to use it”, I found the most challenging aspect of this research project is to set up a smooth data collection -&gt; tagging -&gt; output -&gt; analysis pipeline that allows for automatic syncs and routine tagging, which I was able to eventually achieve by the pipeline architecture in section 3.3. 6.2 What comes next? I decided to put a hard stop on the data cleaning process in Mid-November, as submission gradually dies down. November 25, an apartment fire in Urumqi sparked national outrage, and Chinese people around the world took the streets in a scale unseen since 1989. Due to the time limit of this project, I was unable to track this most recent uptick where the words on the poster peeled off the wall and are chanted in massive rallies. I have started the work of scraping protest data both in and out of China, and would love to continue to track the second episode of the movement. If anything, this EDA project shows the value of continuing to track this dataset. The end goal would be to eventually create an interactive map in D3 that allows the following functions: Shows the geographic spread of the posters; Shows how they pop up over time Being able to filter the map by messages, languages and other features; Double click on the posters to read the message.
